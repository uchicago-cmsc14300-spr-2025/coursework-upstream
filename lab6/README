Lab 6, CMSC 14300, Spring 2025

This directory includes source code implementing a recursive tree sum
and an iterative tree sum. The code works; it is logically
correct. Nevertheless, it contains bugs that can be discovered by very
close reading and/or the assistance of a diagnostic tool like
valgrind.

The contents of this directory:

Makefile     Instructions to compile targets tsr ("tree sum recursive")
	     and tsi ("tree sum iterative"). Also, type "make clean"
	     to remove derived files (executables, etc.).

tree.h	     Int tree data structure and specs for basic operations.

tree.c	     Implementations of the operations from tree.h.

tree_list.h  Linked list of trees data structure, operation specs.

tree_list.c  Implementations of tree list and ops.

tree_stack.h Stack of tree as a container struct pointing to a list.

tree_stack.c Implementation of stack operations.

tree_sum_recursive.c
	     Recursive tree sum and a few tests in main.

tree_sum_iterative.c
	     Iterative tree sum and a few tests in main.
